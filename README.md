# Solar Apocalypse
Solar Apocalypse is a gamemode with a simple core gameplay loop: during the night, players collect resources to build shelters and hideouts; during the day, players hide from the sun.

This is one of my most successful Blockland mods, with Solar Apoc servers regularly drawing lots of players. Other server hosts have also iterated on the original Solar Apoc code, developing their own versions of this mod.

This mod was inspired by and developed shortly after the v21 update to Blockland, also known as the Shadows and Shaders update. Blockland v21 added shadow rendering for the game's sun object, allowing players to see if they were hidden from the sun or not.
